The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is an index that measures market concentration.
Thus, in the context of different elements, it can be used as a proxy for cost, 
as proposed by [M. Gaultois, et. al.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cm400893e).

From the tabulated values in the reference above, we provide HHI values for both 
reserves as well as production.
