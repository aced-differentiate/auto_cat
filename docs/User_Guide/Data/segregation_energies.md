When determining the stability of dopants within a host, one
important factor to consider is the segregation energy. This
predicts the thermodynamic preference towards pinning the 
dopant at the surface of the host versus burying itself in 
the bulk.

Segregation energy values are tabulated as reported by 
[A.V. Ruban, et. al.](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.59.15990)
for multiple combinations of transition metal hosts and dopants. 
By definition more negative values indicate more stability towards 
keeping the dopant at the surface.
Values where the host is the same as the dopant is the surface energy for 
that species.
